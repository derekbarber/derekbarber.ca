I live in the beautiful province of [British Columbia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Columbia),
located along the West Coast of Canada. I think living here has greatly contributed
to everything I do, influencing my music composition and also my work as a software
developer. The environment here makes it very easy to be creative.

From the first time I started playing with computers as a young lad, I was hooked. When
I discovered how to program computers in my early teens (starting with Basic on an Apple II
and then Turbo Pascal on a 286) there was no going back for me. I've been pretty much
programming on various platforms using a myriad of programming languges ever since then.

Currently I am very thankful to currently be employed at [Smartsettle](http://www.smartsettle.com) 
which is a leader in developing software for the emerging e-Negotiation industry. With Smartsettle I am 
privileged to work on technology that truly makes a difference in the world. Smartsettle's vision
is *"resolving conflict in a more peaceful, collaborative and intelligent way throughout
the world"*. Our software is based on [Game Theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory) which
involves mathematical models for resolving conflict and encouraging cooperation between decision makers.

My primary work with Smartsettle involves building their web technology platforms, specifically
[Smartsettle One](https://go.smartsettle.com), which is a web application designed for simple, 
single-issue, two-party negotiations. We are hoping to add multi-issue and multi-party
features in the near future. I also built and continue to manage the 
[International eNegotiation Exhibition](http://enegotiation.org) which has seen the involvement of dozens of universities
from over 30 different countries.

My musical expressions are primarily realized through my band [Greylevel](http://www.greylevel.com), which to
date has released two albums through [ProgRock Records](http://www.therecordlabel.net/progressive-rock/greylevel/).
Our last album, Hypostatic Union, was released in early 2011 and has enjoyed great success. (We are even listed
on ProgArchives [Top Prog Albums for 2011](http://www.progarchives.com/top-prog-albums.asp?syears=2011#list).)
The positive response to this album has been a great encouragement and we are slowly but surely working on
our third album which hopefully will be done in the next couple years.

## A little bit more about me

More importantly than both work and music, I am married to my best friend and we have
three wonderful kids. Most spare moment that I'm not working, you'll probably find me 
spending time with them.

I am also a Christian and that means in addition to reading technicals books I also enjoy theology, 
mysticism, church history, insense, icons, candles and the great discussions that such topics usually bring about. 
One of my favourite places to spend a couple days is our local Benedictine Monastary, [Westminster Abbey](http://www.westminsterabbey.ca/).
