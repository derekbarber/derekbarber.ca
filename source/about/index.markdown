I live in the beautiful Vancouver area of British Columbia, Canada. I think living here has greatly contributed
to everything I do, influencing my music composition and also my work as a software
developer. The environment here makes it very easy to be creative.

From the first time I started playing with computers as a young lad, I was hooked. When
I discovered how to program computers in my early teens (starting with Basic on an Apple II
and then Turbo Pascal on a 286) there was no going back for me. I've been pretty much
programming on various platforms using a myriad of programming languges ever since then.

I've been working remotely from my home office since 2004 and currently my time is split 
between [Lead With Purpose](https://leadwithpurpose.com),
[Provide Chat Software](https://providechat.com) and [Smartsettle](https://smartsettle.com).

I feel extremely blessed that I am able to work a job that I love. If I wasn't getting
paid to write software I would still be doing it in my spare time. The craft of programming
is definitely one of my main passions, along with music, long distance running and yoga.

My musical expressions are primarily realized through my band [Greylevel](http://www.greylevel.com), which to
date has released two albums through [ProgRock Records](http://www.therecordlabel.net/progressive-rock/greylevel/).
Our last album, Hypostatic Union, was released in early 2011 and has enjoyed great success. (We are even listed
on ProgArchives [Top Prog Albums for 2011](http://www.progarchives.com/top-prog-albums.asp?syears=2011#list).)
The positive response to this album has been a great encouragement and we are slowly but surely working on
our third album which hopefully will be done in the next couple years.

## A little bit more about me

I am married to my best friend and we have four wonderful kids, 3 boys and 1 girl. As a family 
we love to get outside and explore nature through camping, hiking and fishing. I've also
begun to teach my older kids some basic programming and share that passion with them.

I am also a Roman Catholic Christian and that means in addition to reading technicals books I also enjoy theology
discussions and spending a couple days at there local Benedictine Monastary, [Westminster Abbey](http://www.westminsterabbey.ca).

If you find any of this interesting, I'd love to hear from you and so please [send me an email](mailto:derek@derekbarber.ca).
