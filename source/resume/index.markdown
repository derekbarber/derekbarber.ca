## Overview

I am an experienced polyglot software developer with a focus on web 
and mobile applications. In recent years my focus has been on 
developing web applications with Ruby, Rails, and JavaScript 
(including Node and React). On the mobile side I have experience 
developing cross-platform apps using React Native as well as building 
native iOS apps using Swift. I also have recently been exploring 
functional programming and have been enjoying Elixir and the Phoenix framework.

I am a continual learner, always seeking to improve myself and my craft. 
I’m not afraid of finding out that I’m wrong and learning a better way to 
do things. I honestly enjoy programming and the process of bringing ideas 
and specifications to life. Writing clean code is a passion of mine 
and so a primary goal is to always write well designed code that is easy 
to change and also easy to test. I’m an avid user of automated testing 
tools and generally practice a test-first approach to development.

## Skills

My primary proficiency is software development with a focus in recent 
years on the Ruby and JavaScript languages, utilizing various frameworks 
including Rails and React. I also have over 20 years of combined experience 
in other programming languages including Java, C/C++, Swift, Python, 
PHP and Elixir.  I have developed for a myriad of platforms throughout
my career including web, mobile, desktop and embedded systems.

In addition I have experience with the following related technologies:

 - Databases: PostgreSQL, MySQL, Redis, MongoDB
 - Linux server administration and application deployment 
 - JavaScript build tools: Webpack and Gulp
 - Front-end web development: HTML, CSS, Sass, responsive design
 - Automated Testing: Rspec, Capybara
 - Version control systems: Git and Subversion
 - Preferred developer tools: Vim and Tmux
