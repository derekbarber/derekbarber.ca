## Overview

I am an experienced full stack software developer with a focus on web-based applications. Some of the 
primary programming languages and technologies that I currently work with include Ruby (and web 
frameworks including Rails and Sinatra), JavaScript (including several frameworks), Node, and Java. 
While it is not my focus I am also proficient in aspects of front-end development including HTML,  
CSS and the complexities around deploying front-end applications.

I am a continual learner, always seeking to improve myself and my craft. I'm not afraid of finding 
out that I'm wrong and learning a better way to do things. I honestly enjoy programming and the process 
of bringing ideas and specifications to life. Writing clean code is a passion of mine and so a primary goal 
is to always write well designed code that is easy to change and also easy to test. I'm an avid user 
of automated testing tools and generally practice a test-first approach to development.
