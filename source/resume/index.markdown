## Overview

I am an experienced full stack software developer with a focus on web-based applications. Some of the 
primary programming languages and technologies that I currently work with include Ruby (and web 
frameworks including Rails and Sinatra), JavaScript (including several frameworks), Node, and Java. 
While it is not my focus I am also proficient in aspects of front-end development including HTML and 
CSS and the complexities around deploying front-end applications.

I am a continual learner, always seeking to improve myself and my craft. I'm not afraid of finding 
out that I'm wrong and learning a better way to do things. I honestly enjoy programming and the process 
of bringing ideas and specifications to life. Writing clean code is a passion of mine and so a primary goal 
is to always write well designed code that is easy to change and also easy to test. I'm an avid user 
of automated testing tools and generally practice a test-first approach to development.

The initial application was built for auctioning motor vehicles and the resulting web app is currently online at

*April 2015 - Present*

I was hired as a Ruby on Rails contractor for Lead With Purpose and have worked with their primary
software developer in adding some new features to their very large web application. I have specifically
worked on a new feature called an "Alignment Survey" which is a tool designed to display and
capture very specific survey results and then process those results for use in their application.

### <a href="https://www.providechat.com" target="_blank">Provide Chat</a>, Co-founder / Software Developer

emerging eNegotiation industry.

I have built several web-based applications in my time at iCan Systems, including a Ruby on Rails based negotiation 
system for use in Debt Resolution cases, a Ruby on Rails web application to manage Financial Disclosure in 
separation agreements, and Smartsettle One, which is a single issue negotiation system built using PHP, JavaScript 
and the Zend Framework.

### <a href="http://www.desiringgod.org" target="_blank">Desiring God Ministries</a>, Contractor
*September 2013 - July 2014*

I worked with a team of programmers and designers on two separate Ruby on Rails applications. I was responsible

*September 2014 - December 2014*

Designed and built a web application for filling out Form F8, which is a legal document required for child

easier to complete through step-by-step, intelligent web forms. At the end of the process a completed PDF could be 
downloaded and printed out.

### Lusora Inc., Software Developer
*2004 - 2007*

Lusora was a leader in developing embedded health care and elder patient care technology. I was the primary developer of 
a server platform in Java which was a communications hub for Lusora's embedded health care devices. 
The embedded devices would connect to the Java server platform and send status updates and alerts, and the server 
platform could also send down commands and updates to the embedded devices. 

Additionally I also built a Java-based web application that would allow the monitoring and management of these
embedded devices.

### Calltrex, Software Developer

provide integrated functionality to call centre agents.

### Shopping Sherlock, Software Developer
*1998 - 2001*

Was the lead software developer on a team responsible for developing e-commerce web-based applications. We 
built several custom online shopping applications initially using Perl and then migrated over to PHP3. One of our
