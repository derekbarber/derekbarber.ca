I was a [VPS.net](http://vps.net) customer for around 11 months and last month I finally made the switch away from VPS to [Storm on Demand](http://stormondemand.com). This switch was a long time coming and the only reason why I held off as long as I did was because it's such a huge job to switch hosting providers. I would have liked to have switched sooner.

My experience at VPS.net began with high hopes. I had a site that was growing in traffic steadily and had outgrown the previous hosting solution. For me the initial killer feature was the ability for VPS.net to dynamically scale your site, thanks to it's cloud-based technology. Thus we would only need to purchase the number of nodes that we immediately need and then scale up over time as traffic (hopefully) increases. We initially started with 2 nodes but over the 11 months we added 4 additional nodes so that when we cancelled, we were running 6 nodes.

What does a node consist of, you might ask? Each node provides 600Mhz of dedicated CPU, 376MB of RAM, 10GB of disk space, and 1TB/month of bandwidth. Typically with VPS.net, the more nodes you purchase the cheaper each successive node becomes.

So regarding the ability to "dynamically" add nodes, as this is one of the key selling features of VPS.net, you would think they would have this down to a science. Well, unfortunately not. Every time we upgraded we experienced anywhere from an hour to multiple hours of downtown. It seemed to get worse with each successive upgrade.

Ah yes downtime. If you're on VPS.net be prepared for much downtime. I lost count of how many times we went down over the 11 months but it was at least 10 times, so roughly once-a-month. This of course, is in addition to the downtime we got each time we upgraded. At least with the downtime we experienced upon upgrading, we could plan for that. However, these days with users accessing your site from all around the world, is there really a *good* time for your site to go down? So, if you want a reliable solution don't even think about using VPS.net.
