It's hard to believe another 365 days have come and gone, the past year 
feeling like a blur and quickly becoming no more than a series of fading 
memories. 

While I find value in keeping the shortness of life in perspective,
I also try to not dwell on the passing moments but to focus on what I can
do in the time that I have ahead of me. As such, one thing that I do appreciate 
about a new year is that it always gives a chance to reflect on the past 
year lived and plan ahead for the coming one. 

One thing that these reflections can lead to are *new years resolutions*. 

Did you make any this year?

#### If you did, how are you doing with them as the year comes to a close?

<!-- more -->

I know for me while I have made many in the past, I have always struggled to actually
maintain them and have them impact my life for the *long term*. 

My typical pattern is an initial few weeks of consistency, followed
by another couple weeks of inconsistency, which ultimately ended in the
abandonment of the resolution. 

I don't think mine is an atypical experience. A common 
experience with new years resolutions tends to be that they start off 
with the best intentions, but they just don't last. 

In my own life I have wrestled with this desire for self improvement
yet dissatisfaction with new years resolutions as a way to achieve positive
and long-term change. Through this process I have gradually come to some helpful realizations
which have made all the difference for me. 

These realizations have caused
me to re-evaluate how I approach self improvement and personal development.
While they may not be a univeral remedy for the problem, I hope the 
following observations will at least be helpful for you as well.


### My Problem with Resolutions

From my own personal experience, I think the problem hasn't been 
*resolutions* as such, but rather the fact that my resolutions tended to 
be **vague and broad sweeping in their scope**. 

In other words, I didn't 
think through and establish a specific plan as to how I would implement
the resolution. I would simply make some bold and decisive change 
such as 

 * "cut out all sugar", 
 * "lose 10 pounds", 
 * "write all code using a test-first approach", 
 * "keep a daily journal", 
 * etc...

January 1st would come and I would start cutting out all sugar
and it would go okay for a while, but it wouldn't take long
before such a drastic and difficult to maintain change would
unravel and I would end up back at square one.

Now, it's probably somewhat an issue of semantics, but what has 
helped me is to stop thinking in terms of *resolutions* but to 
rather think in terms of *goal setting*. So instead of a vague
resolution such as "lose 10 pounds", I would rather set a goal
such as "run a 10K". 

**And here is the key...** 

I wouldn't just set the goal and leave it but I would make a 
specific plan as to how to accomplish it. 

In this example I would find a local 10K race for the spring, 
register in the race and then build a training plan that would 
get me ready for the race. It just so happens
that by training for a 10K, I'd probably lose a few pounds
along the way, maybe even more than 10! 

The difference is that now I have something
**tangible and attainable**, a specific goal that is doable
and I can not only work towards it but know when I've completed
it.

I basically quit making New Years Resolutions several years
ago and instead I simply do the following throughout the year:

 * Set realistic & attainable goals for things I want to accomplish or change in my life
 * Pick a target date by which the goal will be "complete" (however I want to define it)
 * Make a detailed plan as to how I will meet the goal by the chosen date
 * Review regularly, update targets and plan as needed

### Setting Attainable Goals

I think the key to this approach is knowing how to set good
goals. One set of criteria that I have found helpful when
making and reviewing goals is the [SMARTER](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria) 
goals criteria. The SMARTER criteria is a handy mnemonic 
that comes from the world of project management and stands for:

 * **S**pecific
 * **M**easurable
 * **A**ttainable
 * **R**elevant
 * **T**imely
 * **E**valuate
 * **R**eevaluate

As much as I like the SMARTER criteria you can keep it simpler
than that. Do what works for you, that's the most important
thing. I think the key is to start small and win little victories,
building confidence before taking on larger goals.

This is the approach I've taken over the past several years 
and I can't tell you the incredible difference it has made
in my life. 

### Don't wait for January

Another helpful tip is to not wait for January 1st to set new goals. I think the
new year is a good time to review all the goals from the
previous year and either revise them or set new ones. But
this is a practice that I like to do much more regularly. Typically
on a weekly basis. 

I like to use Sunday evenings as a time to review my past 
week and plan for the week ahead and I find it also 
is a good time to briefly review my longer term goals. 
Basically I determine if I'm falling behind and if I need to change
anything to keep them on track. 

Maybe new goals will come
to mind as well and so I'll add them to my list and start
to work on a plan for accomplishing them. If you don't want to
commit to a weekly review then at least monthly is a good
idea. 

### Reflecting back and looking forward

Thanks to this approach, in reflecting back on this past year of 2016 
I can point to specific goals that I was able to accomplish.

One of my primary goals in 2016 was to run in a 10K race. I've always
been a casual runner but I wanted to take it up a notch this year
and set some specific targets in my running.

And so back in January I registered for a 10K that was to take place in June,
plenty of time to train up and be in good shape for the race.

Despite dealing with some minor injuries due to running too much
too soon, I got in the training and the race was a wonderful and
rewarding event.

#### Raising the bar...

After the race I enjoyed it so much that I ended up registering for a second
10K in October and continued my training throughout the year. The
second run was even better and I improved my time by several minutes.

Now with 2017 on the horizon I'm looking increase my running goals further
and so I have registered for a 10K in February and then a Half Marathon
in April. I've never run a half marathon before and so it's a bit intimidating
but with a specific target and a plan, it now becomes attainable.

### Pay your money and put it on your calender

The key for each of these races is that I have already got a date
on the calendar and I've paid money to register for each one. Paying money for
something is a way I've found that makes sure that I have skin in the game, it
greatly increases my level of commitment. In addition for each
of the races I've got training plans and I'm working through those on a daily basis,
ensuring I stay on track.

This process of setting attainable goals and then crafting a plan to make them
a reality has been life changing for me. If it is something that you've never
done and yet you've got a list of failed resolutions it is something you
might want to consider. If you do end trying out the exercise be sure to
let me know and we can encourage each other along.
