As a web developer, I've been using CSS for years but never really took 
the time to learn it. My focus has always been on writing *actual* code and so
when I had to write CSS, I would hack it. I would search for various tutorials 
to get the immediate job done, but never have a full grasp 
of exactly what I was doing. One area that I was fuzzy on was the use of descendent selectors
and as a jQuery user, this lack of knowledge limited what I could do.

So after reading many Amazon reviews, I ordered this book. Much of the book 
was a refresher for me, but I even enjoyed those sections as they helped to 
solidify my knowledge in those areas. Overall, it's very well written and gives 
lots of clear examples. The tutorials at the end of each chapter really get you 
to put into practice the more theoretical concepts in the chapter. 

Overall, I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn CSS or 
grow in this CSS knowledge.
