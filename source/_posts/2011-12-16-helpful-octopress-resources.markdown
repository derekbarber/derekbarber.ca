As I outlined in a [recent post](http://derekbarber.ca/blog/2011/12/08/switching-site-to-octopress/), 
I switched this site from Wordpress to the excellent 
[Octopress](http://octopress.org) blogging framework. I couldn't 
be happier with the switch and I'm not surprised that others feel the same. There were several
blog posts that were helpful in convincing me to move to Octopress
and also in helping ease the transition. I would like to commend some
of these articles to you now, especially if you are considering Octopress for your
blog.

[Blogging with Octopress](http://mattgemmell.com/2011/09/12/blogging-with-octopress/)
by Matt Gemmell is a very helpful post that documents his reasons in moving from
Wordpress to Octopress and gives some useful configuration and workflow tips. I really
identified with almost all of Matt's points and found they mirrored much of my own experience.

[Switching to Octopress](http://zanshin.net/2011/08/11/switching-to-octopress/) by Mark Nichols
outlines how he went about switching from Wordpress to Octopress. A big portion of the
article outlines the process of migrating a significant amount of Wordpress content into
Markdown files. This is a must read if you plan on migrating from Wordpress.

[Forking Octopress](http://zanshin.net/2011/08/27/forking-octopress/), also by Mark Nichols
details how he forked the [Octopress Github repository](https://github.com/imathis/octopress) 
instead of just cloning it. This has allowed him to issue pull requests to the Octopress master 
so that he can contribute his work back to the project. I'm not contributing
back yet but it is something I would like to do in the future, and so this was very helpful in that regard.

Since Octopress is built upon Github's [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll), the more you know about Jekyll, the
better. [How to Use Jekyll](http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/other/building-static-sites-with-jekyll/)
is a great tutorial from Nettuts+ that will walk you though creating a very
basic static blog with Jekyll.

If you're not familiar with Markdown, then you might find this 
[Markdown cheat sheet](http://warpedvisions.org/projects/markdown-cheat-sheet/)
helpful as well.

Of course, the official [Octopress](http://octopress.org) site is a fantastic
resource and is probably the best place to start looking if you're interested
in learning more.

Finally, if I can offer any assistance, please get in touch and I'd be happy
to do so.
