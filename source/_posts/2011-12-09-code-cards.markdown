Who doesn't love handmade letterpress cards? I sure do, and what a pleasure surprise it was to find some custom made letterpress cards for geeks!

My uncle, who is also a fellow geek, sent me a link to [Code Cards](http://www.code-cards.com) about two weeks ago and after a quick browse through the site, I placed my order. I got the *Egg Nog Arrays* cards which includes a set of 4 cards & envelopes, with the cards written in Python, Ruby, PHP and JavaScript.

The cards were dispatched promptly and they arrived earlier this week in perfect condition. The set comes in a protective plastic case and a bubble-wrap envelope, which tells you about the care that goes into the product. The cards themselves are beautifully made on heavy, bright white, acid-free cotton stock.

I encourage you to head on over to [code-cards.com](http://www.code-cards.com) where you can see some high quality images of the cards. Next time I'll be placing an order for a set of *CSS Happy New Year*!
