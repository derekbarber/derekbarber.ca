This is the first book in the highly acclaimed [A Book Apart](http://www.abookapart.com) 
series. As a web developer I found this book to be very helpful in 
presenting a solid introduction to HTML5 that I could put into practice
*right away*.

As the title clearly indicates, this is targeted at web designers, and so
it's somewhat light on the technical details. However, this also means
that the book is highly practical and is full of real-world examples.
There are other books out there which I, as a web developer, can turn 
to for those lower-level details. Before you go ahead and purchase this book
it's important to keep that in mind. You might be better served by
[Introducing HTML5](http://introducinghtml5.com/).

*The bottom line:* a great introduction to HTML5. If you're looking for a book to get you 
started with understanding how to utilizing HTML5 in your website development, 
I'm not aware of a better book.
