It's hard to believe another year has come and gone, and as the new year is almost upon us I hear many people talking about *new years resolutions*. Now, I'm not big on new years resolutions. Sure, I've made several over the years but the typical pattern that resulted was an initial couple weeks of consistency, followed by another couple weeks of inconsistency, which then usually ended in eventual abandonment of the resolution.

I don't think mine is an atypical experience. At least a common thread with new years resolutions tends to be that they start off good, but they just don't last.

Now making resolutions is a great thing, it means that you're not satisfied with a area of your life and you are seeking to improve. Resolutions tend to be quite positive, such as getting in shape, spending more time with the family, getting out of debt, etc. So, why don't they usually work and what can be done to change that?

As we are coming up to another years end, it got me thinking - *if resolutions haven't worked when introducing positive change, what has?*

### The Problem with Resolutions

From my own personal experience, I think the problem hasn't been resolutions as such, but rather the fact that my resolutions tended to be vague and broad sweeping in their scope. In other words, I didn't stop to think about a plan that would help me execute my resolution and I didn't have an actual target that I was aiming for.

Now, it's probably completely an issue of semantics, but what has helped me is to stop thinking in terms of *resolutions* but to rather think in terms of *goal setting*. The difference between these two ideas being that a resolution


### SMARTER Goals

Speaking from my personal experience, what has worked for me is not resolutions, but rather **goal setting**, and specifically [SMARTER](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria) goals. The SMARTER criteria is a handy mnemonic that comes from the world of project management and stands for:

 * **S**pecific
 * **M**easurable
 * **A**ttainable
 * **R**elevant
 * **T**imely
 * **E**valuate
 * **R**eevaluate

What is different about goals compared to resolutions? It's probably more a case of semantics, but one obvious difference is that you can set goals at any time of the year. Making a resolution just because it's January 1st,

 I tend to view resolutions as these major changes that many times tend to be unrealistic and generally involve little to no real planning. Usually a resolution comes out of dissatisfaction with a particular area of your life. Maybe you ate too much junk food over the holidays and you make a somewhat rash resolution to lose some weight and get in shape.

A goal, on the other hand, is something that is well thought out, planned and is realistic.

Say you've never really done much running and so you resolve to start running 4 times a week.

A big benefit to goals is that they can be set at any time of the year. You just need to sit down and think about what you want to accomplish and make a plan. I find it's important to have a big vision of where you might want to go, but then to actually make your objectives to be small and easily attainable.

As an example, one of my current goals is to
