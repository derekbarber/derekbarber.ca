About a year ago I took a class entitled "Advanced Object Oriented Software Development", a significant
portion of which was spent designing and drawing UML diagrams for the software we were
developing. I needed to get up to speed with UML and quickly. To the rescue came this
fantastic book *UML Distilled*, the contents of which are indeed true to the title. It takes a very large and
dense subject like UML and distils it down to the essential aspects.  If you are a working
software developer and want to start utilizing UML in the design of your projects, then this is the book you should get.

Now, anyone who has some serious experience in software development is probably familiar with the name
Martin Fowler. He is probably best known for his classic book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0201485672/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=derebarb-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0201485672">Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=derebarb-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0201485672" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />. In
UML Distilled, Fowler is true to form and not only gives the low down on UML itself, but keeps the
material very interesting and compelling by his own invaluable opinions and experience throughout.
Now, whether you agree with all of Fowler's opinions is besides the point, for me I really appreciate
such anecodes as they get me to think about my own opinions.
