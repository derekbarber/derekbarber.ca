I love [Ruby](http://ruby-lang.org). I know many programmers that were ready to give
up, had even started the search for another career, and then they found Ruby. Or as some might say,
*Ruby found them*. 

**I can relate**. I can't say I was ever actively looking for another career, but the
thought crossed my mind, *"do I really want to still be programming in another 10 years"*?
Can you blame me? I was primarily doing PHP Programming. Not to knock PHP, it works great,
has an incredible amount of resources available, and for many years has gotten the job done. 
The problem is that while I could finish the job, the actual process always left something 
to be desired.

And then I started learning Ruby. I got the [PickAxe](http://pragprog.com/book/ruby3/programming-ruby-1-9)
and [Agile Web Development with Rails](http://pragprog.com/book/rails4/agile-web-development-with-rails)
books and my world was changed. My passion for programming was reignited and a whole series
of events were triggered. I basically just couldn't get enough, the floodgates
opened and I let the Ruby waters sweep me away.

So, that brings us to [Ruby Koans](http://rubykoans.com/). If you are a developer and are looking
for something that will get you excited about programming again, then maybe you
should check out Ruby and I think *Ruby Koans* is one of the best ways to do so.
The fact that Ruby Koans *is what it is*, speaks to how special Ruby is and how incredible
the Ruby community is. Something to keep in mind when you start programming
Ruby is that you also join a community of like-minded programmers, and that benefit
should not be underestimated.
