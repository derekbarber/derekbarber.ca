> Before you play two notes learn how to play one note—and don’t play one note unless 
> you’ve got a reason to play it.
> - **Mark Hollis**

This quote from Mark Hollis has always left a deep impression on me as I have approached both 
software development and songwriting. I have found it to be quite true that with either 
discipline, many times less can in fact be more *(assuming of course that what you call 
"less" is actually any good to begin with)*. 

While engaging in either software development or music composition I always attempt to 
keep this philosophy in mind. In song writing I find there is the temptation to 
add layer upon layer of sound in attempts to mask what is in reality a bad song. 
The same can happen in software development, where a flawed architecture is dressed up
in a beautiful UI. At first it might look impressive but over time the cracks will form
and you'll be left with bad software that is unmaintainable.

It takes hard work to build a good foundation and much of that involves thinking and 
planning before you start to build anything. I think its this initial hard work that we
want to avoid, but in doing so we end up making more work for ourselves in the long
run. It might sound overly simplistic but it really comes down to just figuring out exactly
*what* you want to build *before* you build it. It's just like figuring out what note
you want to play before you play it.
