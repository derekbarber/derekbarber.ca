This is a fantastic book and I would recommend it without hesitation to 
anyone who works as a software developer but is currently in a rut and looking
to revitalize their passion for programming. I am speaking from experience since
a couple years ago, this described me. There was a point that I was even considering
changing industries and looking for another job.

<!-- more -->

Now it wasn't just this book or any single event that helped me to regain my passion for programming,
it was a whole combination of factors. However, this book played a role as it helped me
to regain some perspective and realize that I actually *enjoy* programming. Somehow I
had forgotten that in the midst of the daily grind.

You can play it safe and simply get by in the software industry by doing a decent 
job for your employer and getting your work done adequately. That sort of behaviour will generally 
lead to stagnation and a sense of dissatisfaction with your job (again, speaking from experience). 
This book calls for something different. It calls for software developers to be 
passionate about their work and not settle for mediocre. Take some risks, learn new skills, 
challenge yourself daily, never allow yourself to settle for crap. 

So as you can probably guess, I highly recommend this book. It has really helped me once again be 
excited to be a part of such an innovative and fast-paced industry. I hope it does the same
for you.
