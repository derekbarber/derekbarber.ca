My band [Greylevel](http://greylevel.com) has recently released their sophomore album entitled 
"Hypostatic Union". We worked really hard on it over the course of about 2 years and we are very happy
with the end result.

The album itself is quite an expansive work with long songs that flow into each other.
Lyrically, the album is an exploration into the search for meaning and the discovery
of coherence through a transcendent worldview. Some have called the album *dark* and
*depressing*, which I don't get. It is however an album that, I hope, will give you a window
into some of my thoughts and also cause you to think some of your own thoughts.

If you are a fan of modern progressive rock, or if you're just a fan of music in general,
 then please check it out. If you visit the 
[Greylevel website](http://www.greylevel.com/albums/),Â  
you can listen to song samples and also find out where you can buy a copy, if you
are so inclined.
