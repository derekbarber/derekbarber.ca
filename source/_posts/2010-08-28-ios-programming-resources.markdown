I've found a couple great resources for those interested in getting started 
with iOS development. The first is called [iCode Blog](http://icodeblog.com)
which consists of a great collection of iPhone tutorials. 

I think most developers would agree that one of the best ways to either
learn new programming languages or to simply improve as a developer, is to
read code and learn by example. [Appsamuch](http://www.appsamuck.com AppsAmuck)
is exactly that and has 31 example iPhone applications with the complete
source code for each. In addition, each app comes with a nice step-by-step
guide to get you up and running as quickly as possible.
