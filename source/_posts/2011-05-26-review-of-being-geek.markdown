*Being Geek* by Michael Lopp is an enjoyable and insightful read for anyone in the software
industry, but especially for us developers. The book's subtitle is *"The
Software Developer's Career Handbook"* which I thought was quite apt. 

<!-- more -->

Michael Lopp is someone who has worked as both a software developer and
a manager and so he gives a balanced perspective. As a software developer
you're going to need to deal with managers and so it's good to gain
a better understanding of their perspective. This book will help with that.

One of the things I appreciated was the focus on treating your job as a career, and thus 
thinking about it with a longer term trajectory. I found that helpful, since I know it's 
easy to live in the moment and not think about the bigger picture. If you do
want to progress in your career, you need to have a plan. 

Overall, I would recommend the book. I found it to be a nice break from my
usually reading which consists of much more technical material. If you're interested, 
it's worth checking out (the book's website)[http://www.beinggeek.com] as well.
