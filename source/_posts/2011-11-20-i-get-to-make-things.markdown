The other day I was reflecting on exactly why I loved my job as a software
developer and I came to a very simple conclusion. It's because *I get to make things*.

Could there be an innate desire in us as humans, to create? It seems to be an 
integral part of who we are as a species. We love to create things and we enjoy
the results of other's creations. It is a real privilege, as a software 
developer, to get paid for doing what is naturally fulfilling.

At the core of my work as a software developer, I have an incredible freedom to be 
creative in my day to day work. It is what helps me look forward to each day of work.

Now, it hasn't always been this way. There have been times when I've been stuck
in a rut, pushing out mediocre code, doing the bare minimum that allowed me to
just finish the job. In that state of mind, there was no joy in the work and it all
became tedious. I found that I had to actually *work* to find joy in my work.
Improving my craft through reading books and related websites, taking pride in the
end result, not being satisfied with mediocrity. All this contributes to not
only being better at what you do, but it also makes the work enjoyable.

Now whether or not you are a software developer, I hope you have a job that
gives you the freedom to create something. Its a great feeling to end
a day of work and be able to say to yourself, *"I made something today"*.
